# Connect-Four

- **Gameâ€™s title**: 

  - My game's title is Connect Four. 

  - According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four), Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.

  - The reason why I chose the game is because this is the game I am most familiar with in the game list. Besides, starting this course with little knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS, I believe building a Connect Four game will definitely help me lay my foundation of front-end skills and knowledge.
