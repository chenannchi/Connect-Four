# Connect-Four

- **Your gameâ€™s title**: A description of your game. Background info about why you chose the game is a nice touch.

My game's title is Connect Four. 

According to [WIKIPEDIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)  Connect Four (also known as Connect 4, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Captain's Mistress, Four in a Row, Drop Four, and Gravitrips in the Soviet Union) is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.

The reason why I choose the game is because this is the game I most familiar with in the game list. Besides, starting this course with little knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS, I believe building a Connect Four game will definitely help me lays my foundation of front-end skills and knowledge.
